create a github repo:
    DevOps_Journey

Link a local repo DevOps to DevOps_Journey:
    origin = https://github.com/Shivale20/DevOps_Journey.git   #got it from <>code in repo.
    git remote add origin https://github.com/Shivale20/DevOps_Journey.git
    
Generate a ssh key and save it in .ssh folder as id_rsa.pub. Copy the ssh key and add to my Github profile under SSH and GPG keys.
    ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "manishshivale204@gmail.com"
    #remember the passphrase.
    
Test our connection with github.com
    ssh -T git@github.com
    Enter passphrase for key '/Users/manishshivale/.ssh/id_rsa': 
    Hi Shivale20! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.

Pushing from a local to a remote repo:
    git push origin main
    #look for errors and if needed go for git pull or git push with rebase to merge commits on top of each other.

Merge conflicts
    if making changes in local repo from previous commit in github-- first pull from origin main and then start working.
