Define a variable and set it to permanent 
1. How do you use available permanent ones:
    go to /bin -> printenv
    check all available variable such as PATH, USERNAME etc
    call them like this:
        - echo $PATH
        - echo $USERNAME

Before permanent - create local variable
    VARIABLE = value
    echo VARIABLE
        value
    
Verify the existence of local variable - VARIABLE
    set | grep VARIABLE
        VARIABLE = value

local variable is not environment variable yet
    printenv | grep VARIABLE
     -- no output

Make the local variable - the environment variable
    export VARIABLE

local variable is environment variable now
    printenv | grep VARIABLE
        value

change the environment variable to local variable
    export -n VARIABLE

2. How do you define variable as permanent for both login and no login shells

    Define it in ./bashrc file- so whenever bash shell runs- this script fle executes. The file contains various configuration, comments and functions to customize the shell experience.

3. View all environment variable
    export -p
